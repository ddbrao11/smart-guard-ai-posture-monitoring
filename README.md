# smart-guard-ai-posture-monitoring
Human-centered AI safety system.

## Research Notes
This repository represents ongoing independent research exploration.

## Research Overview
SmartGuard explores edge-based AI systems for real-time
posture monitoring and safety detection for wheelchair users.

The project investigates how computer vision models can
operate efficiently on low-cost embedded hardware.

## Research Motivation
Assistive AI technologies can improve accessibility,
reduce injury risk, and support independent living.

## Research Questions
- Can real-time pose estimation detect unsafe posture reliably?
- How can edge AI enable low-cost assistive systems?
- What design patterns support accessible AI deployment?

## Approach
Pose estimation models integrated with edge computing hardware,
real-time analysis pipelines, and alert mechanisms.

## Limitations
Lighting conditions, camera positioning, and user variability
may affect detection accuracy.
